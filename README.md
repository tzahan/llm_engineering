# üí° AI Resume Tailor
AI Resume Tailor is a small project that personalizes a resume to better match a given job description using Hugging Face Transformers and a Gradio UI.
The goal was to experiment with LLM-powered text rewriting and semantic similarity for career personalization tasks.

I wanted to explore how instruction-tuned, open-source LLMs like Llama 3.1 can be applied to practical personalization problems.
This project helped me combine prompting, embedding-based similarity scoring, and a simple user interface ‚Äî skills that are valuable for building NLP-powered applications.

## üöÄ How It Works
The notebook takes two text inputs:
1. Resume text
2. Job description
   
It then:
- Calculates how closely the resume matches the job using semantic similarity (via sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
- Rewrites the resume using Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to better highlight relevant experience and skills
- Displays both a match score and the tailored resume in a simple Gradio interface
